### **Mini-Project: Build a Real-Time Log Viewer in Kibana**

In this mini-project, we will build a **real-time log viewer** in Kibana that monitors user activity in your Go API. The steps involved will guide you through generating logs, forwarding them to Elasticsearch via Logstash, and creating a dashboard in Kibana to visualize the logs.

The goal of this project is to provide you with hands-on experience in integrating Go with the ELK stack, which can be extended to monitor other aspects of your application and gain insights into its performance.

### **Step 1: Generate Real-Time Logs in Go**

The first step is to create logs that capture key user actions, such as logging in, making requests to your API, and other events that would be useful for monitoring. These logs will be in structured JSON format, which will make them easy to process and visualize.

**Example: Logging User Activity in Go**

1. **Install Logrus**: First, we will use Logrus for structured logging.

   ```bash
   go get github.com/sirupsen/logrus
   ```

2. **Create a Simple API with Logging**:

   Here’s a simple Go HTTP API that logs user activity (like login attempts):

   ```go
   package main

   import (
       "fmt"
       "net/http"
       "github.com/sirupsen/logrus"
   )

   var log = logrus.New()

   func init() {
       log.SetFormatter(&logrus.JSONFormatter{})
   }

   func userLogin(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
       username := r.URL.Query().Get("user")
       log.WithFields(logrus.Fields{
           "event":   "user_login",
           "user":    username,
           "status":  "success",
       }).Info("User logged in")

       fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello %s, you have successfully logged in.", username)
   }

   func main() {
       http.HandleFunc("/login", userLogin)
       log.Info("Server starting on port 8080")
       log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil))
   }
   ```

   - The `userLogin` function logs the event, including the username and status of the login, whenever a user accesses the `/login` endpoint.
   - Logs are written in JSON format, which is ideal for the ELK stack.

3. **Run the Go Application**:

   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

4. **Test the API**:

   You can test the API by sending a request to `http://localhost:8080/login?user=john_doe`. Each login attempt will generate a log in JSON format.

---

### **Step 2: Send Logs to Logstash**

Now that we have our Go application generating structured logs, the next step is to send those logs to **Logstash** for processing and forwarding them to **Elasticsearch**.

1. **Configure Logstash**:

   First, install Logstash on your server if you haven't already. Then create a configuration file for Logstash to receive logs from your Go application.

   Example of a Logstash configuration (`/etc/logstash/conf.d/go-logs.conf`):

   ```bash
   input {
     tcp {
       port => 5044
       codec => json
     }
   }

   filter {
     # You can add custom filters here if necessary
   }

   output {
     elasticsearch {
       hosts => ["http://localhost:9200"]
       index => "user-activity-%{+YYYY.MM.dd}"
     }
   }
   ```

   - The input section listens for incoming logs on TCP port `5044` with JSON formatting.
   - The output section forwards the logs to Elasticsearch, where they are indexed under the name `user-activity-YYYY.MM.DD`.

2. **Start Logstash**:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start logstash
   sudo systemctl enable logstash
   ```

---

### **Step 3: Forward Logs to Elasticsearch**

Ensure that Elasticsearch is up and running. Logstash will forward your logs to Elasticsearch, where they will be indexed and stored for later querying and visualization.

- **Install Elasticsearch** if you don’t have it yet:

  ```bash
  sudo apt install elasticsearch
  ```

- **Start Elasticsearch**:

  ```bash
  sudo systemctl start elasticsearch
  sudo systemctl enable elasticsearch
  ```

Once Elasticsearch is running, Logstash will begin forwarding logs from your Go application, and you can start querying them from Kibana.

---

### **Step 4: Create Kibana Dashboards**

With your logs being indexed in Elasticsearch, you can now use **Kibana** to create real-time visualizations.

1. **Install Kibana**:

   If Kibana is not installed yet, run:

   ```bash
   sudo apt install kibana
   ```

2. **Start Kibana**:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start kibana
   sudo systemctl enable kibana
   ```

3. **Access Kibana**:

   Open a browser and go to `http://localhost:5601`.

4. **Create an Index Pattern**:

   - Go to the **Management** section in Kibana.
   - Click on **Index Patterns**, then click **Create Index Pattern**.
   - Enter `user-activity-*` as the index pattern, and set the time filter field to `@timestamp`.
   - Click **Create Index Pattern**.

5. **Build Visualizations**:

   - Go to **Visualize** and create a new visualization. Choose a **Bar Chart**, **Pie Chart**, or **Line Chart** based on the log data.
   - For example, you could create a bar chart showing the number of login attempts grouped by user.

   **Example visualizations you can create**:

   - **User Login Activity**: A bar chart showing the number of successful and failed logins.
   - **Login Success by User**: A pie chart showing the distribution of successful logins by user.
   - **Activity Over Time**: A line chart that tracks login attempts over time.

6. **Create a Dashboard**:

   - Go to **Dashboard** and click **Create New Dashboard**.
   - Add the visualizations you created, such as login success, activity over time, and user breakdowns.
   - This will give you a live, real-time view of user activity in your application.

### **Conclusion**

Congratulations! You’ve successfully built a **real-time log viewer** using the **ELK Stack** and your Go application. This mini-project demonstrated how to generate structured logs in Go, send them to Logstash for processing, and forward them to Elasticsearch. Finally, you used Kibana to create visualizations and dashboards that allow you to monitor user activity in real-time.

This setup can be extended to monitor more application events, detect anomalies, and create advanced monitoring and alerting systems. As you continue building with Go and the ELK Stack, you’ll have a powerful toolset for troubleshooting and optimizing your applications.
